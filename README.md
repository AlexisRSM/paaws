PAAWS (Pet As A Wellbeing Service)
PAAWS is a platform designed to simplify the adoption or sponsorship of animals, connecting users with animals in need of homes or support. The platform offers a user-friendly experience for tracking contributions to specific animals, whether through sponsorships or the adoption process.

One of PAAWS' core features is ensuring that all adoptions are carefully screened to match animals with suitable, responsible families. This is achieved through an administrator-evaluated questionnaire that helps assess the adopting family's environment, experience, and readiness to welcome an animal into their lives.

Whether you're looking to adopt a pet or sponsor an animal's well-being, PAAWS makes it easy to contribute and stay connected with the animals you care about.

Key Features:

Adoption & Sponsorship Tracking: Users can monitor their contributions and progress with each animal they support.
Questionnaire-Based Evaluation: A thorough vetting process ensures that every adoption is responsible and meets the necessary requirements.
Admin Tools: Platform administrators can review, approve, and track adoption applications to maintain quality standards.
Help create a better future for animals by adopting or sponsoring them through PAAWS!
